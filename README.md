# Microbit

This repository contains the code for the operating system that I'm developing called `Microbit`.

Firstly, thanks to Queso Fuego *(check out his Youtube channel!)* for making this project possible.

The current latest pre-release has a lot of commands which are:
- `dir` / **File Table**
- `reboot` / **Reboot**
- `reg` / **Print Register Values**
- `gfx` / **Graphics Test**
- `cls` / **Clear The Screen**
- `hlt` / **End Program (Halt The CPU)**

This is a picture of the main menu in latest release which is **0.1.0**.

And this is a graphics test which prints a 50x50 green square to the screen. There are many things you can do in Microbit but these are a few of them.

## Running

First, clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/xarcraft-dev/microbit.git`.

Then extract the zip file and go inside the extracted folder.

After that, type `chmod +x install.sh` to give access for installing Microbit. To install Microbit, run `./install.sh`.

That will install and run the operating system. To run the operating system normally, type `./run.sh`.
